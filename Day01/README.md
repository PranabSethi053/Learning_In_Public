*) What is DevOps ?

    DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that unites software development (Dev) and IT  
    operations (Ops) to deliver applications and services faster, more reliably, and with greater 
    quality.



*) What is Automation , Scaling , and Infrastructure ?

    Automation refers to the use of tools and scripts to perform repetitive tasks without manual interv    ention.

    Why it's important:
    1)	Reduces human error
    2)	Speeds up processes like code deployment, testing, and monitoring
    3)	Ensures consistency and repeatability


    Scaling is the ability of a system to handle increased workload by expanding resources (up or out).
    
    Vertical Scaling: Adding more power (CPU/RAM) to an existing server
    Horizontal Scaling: Adding more servers or containers to distribute load


    Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware, software, network, and systems that support your     applications.

    Why it's important:
    1)	Forms the backbone of application performance and security
    2)	Must be version-controlled, repeatable, and easily deployable


*) Why DevOps is Important:

    DevOps is important because it helps bridge the gap between development and operations, allowing 
    teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with fewer errors.
